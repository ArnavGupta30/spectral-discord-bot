# Spectral Discord Bot
A discord bot for https://discord.spectral.host/
## Config
Mostly everything is either channel id or role id or server id
But in `config.join.webhook` enter your webhook url and 
in `config.count.format` enter a format for example if you want your channel to be `Members = 212` then set the config to `Members = :no:`
